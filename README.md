imageProcessing
===============
This project aimed at using the OpenCV algorithms like HaarsCascade algorithms for face decetection and Eigen Faces for 
Face Recognition, in order to automatically detect faces in a class room environment and then use it for various puroposes like 
1. Automated ID card generation
2. Automated Attendance System
3. etc...

The language bunding used was C++, and the IDE : Visual Studio.
The algorithm is a custom  made machine learning algorithm, which uses every new image that is recognised against its learnt face map, to train itself and hence increase its accuracy for the next image to be recognized.
The image source was FaceBook images, whcih were extracted using Facebook Graph APIs.
